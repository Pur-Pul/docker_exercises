I deployed the same application I dockerized in exercise 1.15 to fly.io. 
This application lets you generate images using markov chains trained on various included pictures (mostly of cats).

The dockerfile:
Python 3.8 is downloaded.
The port 8080 is exposed, which is the default internal port used by fly.
The working directory is then set to be /usr/src/app and then all files in the project are copied over.
Information about the dependencies are found in requirements.txt, which are then installed.
The application is then started with the command "invoke start --web", 
the "--web" tag specifies to start the web application version as the application can also be run in the terminal.

Pushing the project to fly.io was easily done with the command "fly launch". 
Fly automatically detected the dockerfile and proceeded to ask setup instructions (name, database etc.)

The published application can be found at: https://markov-chain.fly.dev/
